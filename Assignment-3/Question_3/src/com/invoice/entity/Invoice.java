 * Q3. Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that
 * you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has
 * other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic
 * congestion. The application should input the following information and
 * display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work: a) Total miles driven per
 * day. b) Cost per gallon of gasoline. c) Average miles per gallon. d) Parking
 * fees per day. e) Tolls per day.
